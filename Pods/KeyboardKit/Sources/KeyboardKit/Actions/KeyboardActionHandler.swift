 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can handle
 keyboard actions that are triggered in a keyboard extension.
 
 The standard `StandardKeyboardActionHandler` action handler
 is used by default by `KeyboardInputViewController`. It can
 be subclassed and extended with app-specific logic (see the
 demo) or replaced by a completely different implementation.
